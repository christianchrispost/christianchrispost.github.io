## Awards & Recognition
- **[Best Poster Award — 2024](/awards/)**
  - *[WiNLP](https://openreview.net/forum?id=X8Mdv9qLOS) @ [EMNLP 2024](https://2024.emnlp.org/), Miami, FL, USA* — **"Probing the Robustness of Theory of Mind in Large Language Models"** — with Laura Schrewe
  - Large Language Models fail to attribute beliefs to others in non-trivial situations; Chain-of-Thought reasoning seldom helps.
