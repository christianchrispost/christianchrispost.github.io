## Who I Am
I am Chris — a Computer Scientist and AI Researcher, currently working as a full-time researcher at the
[Research Center Trustworthy Data Science and Security (RC-Trust)](https://rc-trust.ai)
and the University of Duisburg-Essen, in the Human Understanding of Algorithms and Machines (HUAM) group.
My work there investigates shifts in human strategic behavior in economic games when facing
AI opponents — at the intersection of AI, behavioral science, and human cognition.
In a parallel project with [Dr. Florian Mai](https://florianmai.github.io/) (University of Bonn),
I investigate the steerability of LLM agents with respect to predefined rules and properties in
social environments — analyzing how targeted interventions shape model reasoning and subsequent
behavior. A pre-print will be available soon.

## Research Journey
My path toward AI safety and human–AI interaction grew through a series of research experiences
that each deepened my understanding of what makes AI trustworthy.

During and after my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, I worked at the
[Data Science & Language Technologies Group (CAISA Lab)](https://caisa-lab.github.io/),
advised by Prof. Dr. Lucie Flek, focusing on Reasoning Chains and Faithfulness in LLMs.
Together with Laura Schrewe, I developed a novel benchmark of perturbed Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks
and metrics for AI reasoning correctness — work that earned us the
**[Best Poster Award](/awards/) at [WiNLP @ EMNLP 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06271)** in Miami.
A follow-up paper was presented at the [ToM4AI workshop at AAAI 2025](https://tom4ai.github.io),
and an extended version probing reasoning robustness is now available as a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22072).

Before my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at the
[Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology (FIT)](https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/)
on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT/Blockchain) and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions,
with a focus on usability and interoperability. During my studies at Bonn, I also served as a
Teaching Assistant for the "Human-Computer Interaction" course under Prof. Dr. Matthew Smith
and the "Data-Centric Computer Science" course under Prof. Dr. Christian Bauckhage.

Earlier projects include RansomDenied, a user-centered ransomware-resistant backup system,
and my Bachelor's thesis on the privacy compliance of smart cameras across different jurisdictions —
analyzing network traffic and evaluating GDPR conformity.

## Beyond Research
I am passionate about approaches that merge disciplines and push the boundaries of what we understand —
in and outside of research. Some things I find myself thinking about, exploring or building in my spare time:

- **FOSS Smart Home** — a self-hosted, privacy-preserving stack centered around [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
- **Hi-Fi and Acoustics** — the bridge between physical properties of sound and human perception:
  why does a speaker sound "warm" or "slow", and what does that mean in measurable quantities?
- **Astronomy and Physics** — exploring the cosmos at large and niche corners of physics like Bohmian Mechanics
- **Historic Technology and Engineering** — from ancient architecture to early engineering marvels
  (Vitruvius' *De Architectura* sits on my shelf — waiting for someone else to also notice it...)
- **Exploring Places** — on foot, eMTB, or road trip: lively cities, abandoned monasteries,
  deserted landscapes, and everything in between
