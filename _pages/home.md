## Welcome
I am Chris, a Computer Scientist and AI Researcher with interests in AI safety and security, steerability, reasoning and tool usage, human–AI interaction (HAI), as well as decentralized, secure and privacy-preserving local / on-premise compute.

While my current focus is on generative AI, I also maintain an interest in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and smart contracts.

I currently work as a full-time researcher at the [Research Center Trustworthy Data Science and Security (RC-Trust)](https://rc-trust.ai) and the University of Duisburg-Essen, in the group “Human Understanding of Algorithms and Machines” (HUAM), which focuses on behavioral effects in humans in relation to AI.

I believe that current and next-generation generative AI can help us make tremendous scientific progress and unlock substantial economic potential. To reap these benefits even in safety-critical environments and increase its utility for scientific and technological progress, we need to take a closer look at:

- Reasoning and the workings of tool calling, including advanced architectures with memory.
- Fundamental questions of AI safety and (cyber-)security,
  - especially alignment and model behavior analysis (from simple sandboxes to entire world models like [Genie 3](https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/)),
  - usable security and HCI,
    - correct user modeling and [Theory of Mind (ToM) in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06271),
    - anticipating human behaviors in relation to AI,
  - model steerability, deception and “sleeper agents” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566),
  - other adversarial behaviors, [deception and blackmail](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-4-system-card)
(e.g., [Agentic Misalignment](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment)),
  - selective information disclosure, the mechanics of jailbreaks and[secret exfiltration via coding agents](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/promptpwnd-github-actions-ai-agents)
(e.g., [CamoLeak in GitHub Copilot](https://dataconomy.com/2025/10/15/attackers-used-ai-prompts-to-silently-exfiltrate-code-from-github-repositories/)).
- Future pathways to decentralized, efficient deployments, whether on-premise (local) or in space (e.g., SpaceX's planned [orbital AI data center megaconstellation](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-seeks-fcc-nod-solar-powered-satellite-data-centers-ai-2026-01-31/)
  and its [merger with xAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/musks-xai-needs-spacex-for-money-data-centers-in-space-are-a-dream.html)).

Holding an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Bonn, Germany, I seek to address these questions in my PhD research. I am passionate about interdisciplinary approaches that push the boundaries of AI and its applications and enjoy collaborating with researchers and practitioners across relevant fields.
