## Welcome
I am Chris, a Computer Scientist and AI Researcher with interests in AI safety and security, steerability, reasoning and tool usage, human–AI interaction (HAI), as well as decentralized, secure and privacy-preserving local / on-premise compute. While my current focus is on generative AI, I also maintain an interest in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and smart contracts.
I believe that current and next-generation generative AI can help us make tremendous scientific progress and unlock substantial economic potential. To reap these benefits even in safety-critical environments and increase its utility for scientific and technological progress, we need to take a closer look at AI-Safety and AI related Cybersecurity, while also investigating the mechanics of model reasoning and tool-calling and also considering the human component.
Holding an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Bonn, Germany, I seek to address these questions in my future PhD research. I am passionate about interdisciplinary approaches that push the boundaries of AI and its applications and enjoy collaborating with researchers and practitioners across relevant fields.
I currently work as a full-time researcher at the [Research Center Trustworthy Data Science and Security (RC-Trust)](https://rc-trust.ai) and the University of Duisburg-Essen, in the group “Human Understanding of Algorithms and Machines” (HUAM), which focuses on behavioral effects in humans in relation to AI.
