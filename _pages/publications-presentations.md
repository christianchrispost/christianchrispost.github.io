## Research Projects

### Ongoing

**LLM Agent Steerability in Social Environments** *(2024 – present)*  
*In collaboration with [Dr. Florian Mai](https://florianmai.github.io/), University of Bonn*

Investigating the steerability of LLM agents with respect to predefined rules, values, and
properties in social environments. We analyze how targeted interventions shape model reasoning
and subsequent behavior — evaluating the impact of reasoning chains on resulting behavior and
going beyond purely linguistic analysis to study behavioral shifts directly. Pre-print forthcoming.

**Strategic Human–AI Interaction in Economic Games** *(2025 – present)*  
*RC-Trust / HUAM Group, University of Duisburg-Essen*

Studying how human strategic behavior shifts in economic games when participants face AI
opponents rather than human ones. The project investigates behavioral patterns, adaptation
strategies, and the cognitive effects of perceived AI agency on human decision-making.

### Completed

**Theory of Mind in Large Language Models** *(2024)*  
*CAISA Lab, University of Bonn*

Developed a comprehensive human-written and annotated benchmark dataset of 68 tasks across 10
complexity classes for evaluating Theory of Mind in LLMs. Created novel metrics for assessing
Chain-of-Thought reasoning correctness and investigated robustness of ToM capabilities under
various perturbations. Presented at WiNLP @ EMNLP 2024 (Best Poster Award) and ToM4AI @ AAAI 2025.  
[\[arXiv\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06271)

**Human vs Machine Attention Analysis** *(2023)*  
*Lab: Development and Application of Data Mining, University of Bonn*

Compared human eye-tracking data with machine attention mechanisms in NLP. Analyzed correlation
between human fixation patterns and machine saliency scores, and evaluated differences between
English and German language processing.

**Ethics in Autonomous Weapon Systems** *(2023)*  
*AI Ethics Seminar, University of Bonn*

Analyzed ethical implications and the legal framework of autonomous weapons systems. Evaluated
concepts of meaningful human control in military AI applications.

**Privacy Analysis of IoT Devices** *(2021)*  
*Bachelor Thesis, University of Bonn*

Developed a methodology for analyzing privacy compliance of IoT devices. Conducted comparative
analysis of smart cameras from different jurisdictions, implemented a network traffic analysis
setup using Raspberry Pi, and created an evaluation framework based on GDPR requirements.

**RansomDenied: Usable Ransomware-Resistant Backup System** *(2020)*  
*Bachelor Lab Project, University of Bonn*

Designed and implemented a user-friendly backup system resistant to ransomware attacks.
Conducted user research including expert interviews and requirements analysis, applying
user-centered design principles to a security-critical application.

**Self-Sovereign Identity and DLT Solutions** *(2022 – 2023)*  
*Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology (FIT)*

Worked on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT/Blockchain) solutions with a focus on usability
and interoperability.

**ReselMusic: Cloud-based Multi-User Social Playlist Service** *(2014)*  
*Private Project*

Designed and implemented a cloud service for multimedia aggregation in playlists. PartyMode
allowed users to check in via QR code and contribute to a shared playlist in real time.
